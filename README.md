Project Content
The aim of the project is to estimate the approximate cost of a person's health insurance based on previously mentioned variables. For this purpose, we created the infrastructure of the project with the python programming language. The purpose of using the python language is that python has library support and is easy to use. We performed exploratory data analysis with the data set given to us. In the next stages, we determined the most suitable model according to the data obtained and carried out the analysis.
