# Project Content

The aim of the project is to estimate the approximate cost of a person's health insurance based on previously mentioned variables. For this purpose, we created the infrastructure of the project with the python programming language. The purpose of using the python language is that python has library support and is easy to use. We performed exploratory data analysis with the data set given to us. In the next stages, we determined the most suitable model according to the data obtained and carried out the analysis.


# Libraries

  * import numpy as np
  * import pandas as pd
  * import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  * import seaborn as sns
  * import sklearn

# Model Regression

There are multiple regressions, multiple optimizations and parameters. We tried them one by one to find the most accurate method, and we got the best results in linear and lasso regression's alpha 0.01 parameter optimized with polynomial regression. Accurancy values reached 83% in both.
